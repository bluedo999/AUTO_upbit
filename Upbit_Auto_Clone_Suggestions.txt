This error message usually occurs when you are trying to clone a repository using HTTPS and Git is unable to authenticate your credentials. Here are a few suggestions to resolve this issue:

1. Check your GitHub credentials: Make sure that you are using the correct username and password to authenticate your GitHub account. You can also try resetting your password to see if that resolves the issue.

2. Use SSH instead of HTTPS: Instead of using HTTPS, you can try cloning the repository using SSH. To do this, you will need to generate an SSH key and add it to your GitHub account. You can find detailed instructions on how to do this in the GitHub documentation.

3. Use a personal access token: GitHub allows you to use a personal access token instead of your password to authenticate your account. You can generate a personal access token in your GitHub account settings and use it to clone the repository.

4. Check your network settings: Sometimes, network settings can interfere with Git's ability to authenticate your credentials. Make sure that your firewall or proxy settings are not blocking Git's access to GitHub.
