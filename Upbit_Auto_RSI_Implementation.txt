To implement the RSI indicator in a trading strategy, traders can use the swing rejection signal. The RSI is designed to indicate whether a security is overbought or oversold in relation to recent price levels, and it is most useful in an oscillating market where the asset price is alternating between bullish and bearish movements. However, its signals are most reliable when they conform to the long-term trend, and true reversal signals are rare and can be difficult to separate from false alarms. Traders can modify RSI levels to fit trends and use buy and sell signals that fit trends. The RSI can also indicate securities that may be primed for a trend reversal or corrective pullback in price.
