Suggestions for improving the Upbit_Auto_Api.py code:

1. Use descriptive variable names: Use variable names that clearly describe what the variable represents. This makes the code more readable and easier to understand.

2. Break down complex functions: If a function is too long or complex, consider breaking it down into smaller, more manageable functions. This makes the code easier to read and maintain.

3. Use comments: Use comments to explain what the code is doing. This makes it easier for other developers to understand the code and make changes if necessary.

4. Error handling: Make sure to include error handling in the code to handle unexpected situations and prevent the code from crashing.

5. Use libraries: Use existing libraries and modules to simplify the code and reduce the amount of code that needs to be written. This can save time and reduce the risk of errors.
