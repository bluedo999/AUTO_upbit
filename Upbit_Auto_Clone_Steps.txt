Steps for generating a personal access token and cloning the Upbit_Auto repository:

1. Log in to your GitHub account and go to your account settings.
2. Click on "Developer settings" in the left sidebar and then click on "Personal access tokens".
3. Click on the "Generate new token" button.
4. Give your token a name and select the scopes that you need. For cloning a public repository, you only need the "public_repo" scope.
5. Click on the "Generate token" button.
6. Copy the token to your clipboard. Note that you will not be able to see the token again after you close the page, so make sure to copy it somewhere safe.
7. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the Upbit_Auto repository.
8. Use the following command to clone the repository, replacing "YOUR_TOKEN" with the personal access token you generated in step 6:

    git clone https://github.com/yuns-dev/Upbit_Auto.git

9. When prompted for your GitHub username and password, enter your username and use the personal access token as your password.
